# Theme Pokédex Explorer

## A Pokémon Quiz Application

### Overview

Pokédex Explorer is a Pokémon quiz application where players test their knowledge by identifying Pokémon based on their names and weights. The app includes two main quiz features: Tebak Nama Pokémon (Guess the Pokémon's Name) and Tebak Berat Pokémon (Guess the Pokémon's Weight). Inspired by the concept of a Pokédex, players interact with the app as if they are filling out their own Pokédex by correctly identifying and comparing Pokémon.

### Features

- Guess Pokémon Name:

Players are shown an image of a Pokémon and must choose the correct name from two options.
After the guess, the correct answer is revealed along with whether the player's selection was right or wrong.
The player has six attempts, and the score is displayed at the end.

- Guess Pokémon Weight:

Players are shown two Pokémon and must guess which one is heavier.
After the guess, the actual weights of both Pokémon are revealed along with the result.
Similar to the name guessing game, the player has six attempts and the score is shown at the end.
